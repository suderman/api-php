# Edit/rename/move/symlink this configuration file to api.yml and/or ~/.api
# 
# The CLI tool (api) will look in the home dir for .api or the current dir for api.yml
# The web server index.php will look in it's own directory for api.yml
#
# You should probably keep the real api.yml somewhere safe and then 
# symlink it to the two locations it's expected to be found.
